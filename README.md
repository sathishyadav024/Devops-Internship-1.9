# `ECS Autoscaling with Terraform: Dynamic Container Scaling for Optimized Resource Utilization`

The project contains Terraform scripts to deploy a Medusa backend on AWS using ECS and RDS. The infrastructure includes VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS cluster, auto-scaling policies, and an RDS PostgreSQL database









## `Project Objectives`

`Dynamic Resource Management:`

 Automatically adjust the number of ECS tasks based on real-time CPU and memory usage to optimize resource allocation.

`Cost Efficiency:` 

Reduce operational costs during low-demand periods by minimizing the number of running tasks while ensuring that sufficient resources are available during peak traffic.

`Improved Performance:`

 Maintain high application performance and availability by quickly scaling out additional resources to handle increased workloads.

`Enhanced Reliability:`

 Ensure that the Medusa backend remains responsive and reliable, providing a seamless user experience even under varying load conditions.

`Scalability:`

 Facilitate the growth of the application by allowing it to handle increased traffic without manual intervention or downtime.
